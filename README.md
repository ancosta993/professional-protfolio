# Profession Protfolio

## Introduction
A protfolio in progression for myself (Anthony Dcosta). It gathers all the projects in one place and showcases them thorugh CSS styling. Besides that, it also provides information about myself. Only HTML and CSS are being used in this project. Javascript will be used later on for new features.


## Website Structure
The website is structed with ` <header>  <main> <footer>`. The `<main>` is further devided into `<section>`.
These `<section>`s are given class attribute for hero, about-me, my-work, contact-me.
### Header 
Header contains the primary navigation bar, which is structured implemented by nesting `<nav> <ul> <li> <a>`. `nav` is used for semantic HTML. The actual styles of CSS was applied to `ul`, `li`, `a` elements.

Flexbox is used for expanding the links and the logo horizontally. Then CSS prpoerties and psuedo class `:hover` was used to add styling to indivual links for scaling and background.

### Hero
Serves as an indtroduction for the protfolio website with a background image, name, and a quote. The background image was `fixed` attached with the header for smooth transition to the hero section. The name and the quote was centered.

### About me
Used dark overall brackground. `<article>` tag was used to display my information: my image and my-text. Flexbox is used for the image and my-text to center them horizontally. `<box-shadow>` is used for the `<article>` for a 3D feeling. Furthermore, `<box-shadow>` is used with `inset` value for the text for an emphasize. 

### My Work

### Contact me
Contact me section contains the links to social media and a title, for now. The links are also styled to scale with `:hover` pseudo calss. Flexbox was used to center the links and the header.
